<h1 class="section-heading">Cultures of Belize</h1>
<p> Belize is unique in its geographical location. We are situated in Central America south of Mexico and East of Guatemla. But we are on the shores of the Caribbean Sea which has contributed to the mixing pot we call Belize today.</p>
<p>Originally a colony of Great Britian, Belize had a sizable slave labour force imported to timber. Apart from the British who brought Africian slaves to our shores there are also the immigrates that originate from Central America.</p>
<p>There are five major ethnic groups in Belize, Garifuna, Maya, Mestizo, East Indians, and Menonities.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Garifuna People</h2>
<p>The Garinagu first came to Belize from St. Vincent in the Caribbean. They are a mixture of Africian and indiginous Kalinago-Taino origin. They largely settled in the southern parts of the country which has become known as the culture capital of Belize. With them they brought music known as "Punta Rock", asortment of foods, and their cultural beliefs.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Maya People</h3>
<p>The Maya were the original inhabitants of Belize, and actually a large part of Central America in the regions of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The Mayas are best known for the many temples ruins they left behind from the height of their civilization. Some of the more popular sites include: Caracol, Xuanantunich, Altun Ha, La Milpa, and Lamanai. Today the Maya people can still be found in little villages located in the far south of the country where they still speak their native languages and live in tatch houses.

<h4 class="section-heading">Mestizo People</h4>
<p>The Mestizo are immigrates that fled Mexico in the 19th century during the Caste War. The Mestizos brought along with them their foods, religion, and their culture. When they migrated to Belize initially they stayed mostly in the North of the country and can still be found largely in the Northern districts. Amoug other things the Mestizos are best known for their foods which include tacos, tamales, escabeche, and relleno. I should inject here that these are my favorite food.</p>
