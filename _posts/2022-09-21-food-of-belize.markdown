<h2 class="section-heading">Relleno</h2>
<p>Relleno is a black soup of Mestizo origins and is typically eaten with corn tortilla. It gets its distinct color from the spicy black recado that is used. It also made with local chicken stuffed with ground pork and diced boiled eggs. This dish is very popular during Christmas time in Belize.
